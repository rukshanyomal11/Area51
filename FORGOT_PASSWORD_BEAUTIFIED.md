# Forgot Password Page - Beautification Complete! ✨

## What Was Done

### 1. Fixed Cart Logout Issue
**Problem**: When users logged out, the cart was cleared from localStorage but NOT from the database. When they logged back in, the cart reappeared.

**Solution**:
- Added a `DELETE /` route in `cart.js` to clear the cart from the database
- Updated `Navigation.jsx` to call this endpoint on logout
- Updated `AuthContext.jsx` to clear cart from localStorage on logout

**Result**: ✅ Cart is now completely cleared on logout (both localStorage AND database)

### 2. Fixed Forgot Password 500 Error
**Problem**: The forgot password feature was returning a 500 Internal Server Error.

**Root Causes**:
- Spaces in the `EMAIL_PASS` environment variable
- Missing error handling and validation
- Generic error messages

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Removed spaces from `EMAIL_PASS` in `.env` file
- ✅ Added validation to check if email credentials exist
- ✅ Improved error handling with specific error messages
- ✅ Added detailed console logs for debugging
